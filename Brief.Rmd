##Goals:
* Illuminate the sheer quantity and power of the BpS model data
* Highlight methods
* Showcase distrubance ecology *for the nation*
* Develop and practice relevant R code; deliver if appropriate
* Set up data for delivery and accompanying Shiny app (which could be delivery mechanism)
* Make beautiful graphs and maps

##Figure brainstorm:
* Choropleth of dist by map zone (map per disturbance type)
* Pirate plots with each "bar" representing broadest veg classes (e.g. grassland), each plot disturbance type, each bean a BpS
* New Fire Severity and/or MFRI maps?
* Percent FRG graph
* Basic chart of area disturbed by disturbance type per year
